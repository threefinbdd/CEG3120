# CEG3120:  Design of Information Technology Systems
## Brandon's classwork for the class CEG3120
### Project 1:
The purpose of this project was to act as an introductory into the Linux BASH environment while also re-visiting the scripting language.  The bddStartUp.sh bash script is ideally the only script I will need to run in order to get any and all environments set up to my preference.  This includes pre-setting aliases, color options, adding a quirky MOTD, and so on and so forth.

## Project 2:
The purpose of this project was to simulate a company's needs and accessibility to different services hosted on varying machines utilizing AWS.  
Part 1:  Create and set up Cloud with associated services  
Part 2:  Create a template to automate cloud creation vs using AWS wizard.  Create a script to read from a file to create users.  
Part 3:  Configure a template to automate cloud creation and web servers with set up that utilizes load balancers (HAProxy).
